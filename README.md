# DevOps Learning â€“ Bash Scripting

A collection of scripts, notes, and challenges created while learning **Bash scripting** for DevOps workflows.  
Every script in this repo has been written, debugged, and tested from scratch â€” no copy-paste.  
This project serves as both a learning log and a reference for real-world automation tasks.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Bash Scripting Matters for DevOps

Bash scripting is a core skill for DevOps engineers because it enables automation of repetitive tasks, consistent server configuration, and efficient system management across multiple environments.  
In real-world DevOps work, Bash is used to:

- **Automate deployments** â€” run builds, move files, configure servers.
- **Manage infrastructure** â€” monitor disk usage, rotate logs, create backups.
- **Integrate with CI/CD pipelines** â€” run test scripts, set environment variables, prepare artifacts.
- **Improve reliability** â€” add error handling (`set -e`, exit codes) to ensure failures are caught early.
- **Save time** â€” replace manual, error-prone steps with predictable scripts.

By mastering Bash, a DevOps engineer can bridge the gap between development and operations, ensuring faster delivery, fewer errors, and more scalable systems.
